# COMP 2156 â€“ DevOps for System Administration âœ¨ðŸ’»

This repo contains coursework and lab exercises completed as part of the COMP 2156 course at George Brown College. The course focused on:

- Git & GitHub fundamentals
- Version control workflows
- Repo structuring
- Basic DevOps concepts (intro-level)

> This was my introduction to GitHub, version control, and DevOps principles. It also taught me that even during dissociative episodes, I can still push commits like a pro.
